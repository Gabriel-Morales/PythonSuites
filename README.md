# PythonSuites
A somewhat-complete directory of practical practice suites for the python programming language.

This project is something I decided to make for myself a few years ago to get a little more knowledge for the Python programming language. Specifically, you will build basic data structures using concepts such as inheritence and classes, along with provided test cases and my own solutions.
