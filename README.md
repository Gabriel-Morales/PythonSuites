# PythonSuites
A somewhat-complete directory of practical practice suites for the python programming language.

This project is something I decided to make for myself a few years ago to get a little more knowledge for the Python programming language. Specifically, you will build basic data structures using concepts such as inheritence and classes, along with provided test cases and my own solutions. 

Note: I never came back to finish these (and likely will not), but you may use them as you wish.
Note 2: Big-O demo is intended as a demonstration of linear search versus binary search (e.g., O(n) versus O(log n)). The original "in.txt" input file is too large to put here on GitHub, but you can make your own "in.txt" by having millions of sequential intergers separated by a newline. Cheers!
